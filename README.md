MetaHN
======

MetaHN will be a subtle yet powerful chrome extension for hacker news. It will be oriented around a nearly impossible to notice badged dropdown menu replacing the y-combinator logo on the top left of HN.

Design wise, the goal is to interfere as little as possible with the existing HN.  So any links should look like HN links, buttons like HN buttons etc.  There should be very few changes to the interface (unless they make total sense) outside of the dropdown.
